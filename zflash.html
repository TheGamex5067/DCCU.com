                   <p class="Movies"> Red light flashes across the screen as we see a person dressed in yellow with red lightning run away then we hear a sonic boom yellow light follows and disappears.
                    Young Barry Allen (Walker Scobell) having seen all this rushes to his house to find his dad with his mom's (Sarah Drew) dead body. Barry calls the cops, and the lead detective Darryl Frye (Aaron Eckhart) assumes Barry's father (Justin Hartley)
                    murdered his wife. Barry's father is sentenced to life in prison without parole as there were no apparent witnesses.<br> 
                    <br>
                    Barry is raised by Darryl and grows up to be a CSI working 
                    alongside his foster father.
                    Adult Barry (Lucas Till) while rushing to work gets a call from Wally (Kj Apa) asking if they could hang out later Barry says he's busy as he has a lot of work to get through Wally chuckles and says he's always 
                    busy Barry feels bad and apologizes and says we'll hang out soon. Barry trips and Darryl tells Barry you're late don't you think you should try and be a little faster, so you don't get fired 
                    it was a pain getting you this job Barry. Barry apologizes and chuckles as he tells Darryl he has whipped cream on his face. Barry goes into his lab and gets a call from Iris saying she hasn't seen 
                    him in a while and misses him Barry hasn't seen Iris(Holland Roden) cause he's in love with her but doesn't know how to tell her. Barry apologizes and says Wally just told me the same thing maybe we should hang 
                    out sometime. 4 hours pass and Barry is exhausted from all the work he's been doing but as he packs up he drops a red vial. At that moment a sudden change in weather created a thunderstorm. 
                    Out of that storm came a lightning bolt of unusual lightning that appeared yellow that hits Barry causing him to be knocked unconscious.

                    <br>
                     Spending days in the hospital Barry wakes up and is 
                    frantic as he has no idea what has happened. The doctor (Ken Jeong) calls Darryl and informs him that Barry has woken up and that he's asking for him.
                     Darryl picks Barry up from the hospital and brings 
                    him home telling him needs to rest but Barry doesn't listen and goes to meet up with Wally and Iris. We flash back to Barry crying when he finds his mother as we. Realize that Wally Barry and 
                    Iris have been friends since childhood. On his way to meet up with Wally and Iris Barry feels a shock in his body and when he looks around he realizes he's 20 feet away from where he was. Barry confused 
                    Thinks he just blacked out and keeps walking. He gets to his destination in just a minute which feels weird for him since he lives a mile away. Just then Barry feels another shock and 
                    walks inside the cafe where he was going to meet Wally and Iris but everything is standing still to him. Confused he runs to his lab which is 3 miles away but gets there in 2 minutes. Barry conducts 
                    some tests on himself but finds nothing has changed except he is in much greater health. Wally calls Barry and asks where he is but Barry tells Wally he had a physical emergency and couldn't make 
                    it. Wally is worried about Barry and asks if he needs help, but Barry says he’s ok that he’ll call him tomorrow. Barry does research into his abilities and realizes he has super speed and bunch of other abilities. He runs for a while, but his clothes are immediately burned and destroyed. Barry buys a lot of friction proof strong fabric and creates a fully red suit that won’t burn or break when he runs. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile, a man by the name of Russel Grosson (Danny Devito)discovers he can slow the progression of time by absorbing the kinetic energy around him as can negate the movement of objects. He uses this ability for his commercial gain and starts stealing from banks, the only downside to this ability however is that he now appears as a short old man.
                    <br>
                    <br> Barry decides to start using his new abilities to 
                    do good and saves an older woman from an oncoming bus (that woman will become relevant in the future) Barry sees bank crime being committed and runs to it however scared cause as he was running he felt his skin like if it were on fire. Nevertheless, he goes inside the bank and finds Russel (now calling himself the turtle) robbing the bank. Barry laughs as Russel appears like an old man however when he runs, he takes a long time to get to where he was going and soon realizes that Turtle can take away his kinetic energy rendering him slow. Turtle baffled as to how this man can still move 
                    leaves in disbelief. Barry after looking more into his abilities concludes that the energy that gives him speed must come from somewhere. After a lot of research, he nicknames the source of energy as the velocity field of infinite energy although thinks to himself that it needs a better name. He does some test runs and still feels as if his body is being 
                    disintegrated when he runs. Wally shows up at the lab wondering where Barry is as Barry hide what he's doing from Wally, and they go to a cafe. Wally tells Barry that his aunt has been wondering about him and that he should really ask her out cause there's a chance she feels the 
                    same. Barry does and Iris accepts as she's had a crush on him for years. Barry runs into the turtle a couple of times but is never able to catch him. Fascinated by Barry turtle follows him to his date 
                    with Iris. When Iris and Barry were finally having a nice moment turtle attacks.
                    <br>
                    <br> Barry with his suit under his clothes tells Iris not to be shocked and changes at super speed. He smiles and tells 
                    himself he needs to find a better way to do that. Turtle realizes that every time Barry's energy is around him turtle starts feeling younger, so turtle expands his abilities and absorbs the kinetic energy around him. Barry not figuring out a way to defeat him and still worried about his abilities runs around the turtle's aura to try and make it smaller. It however makes things 
                    worse as his energy is making the turtle stronger. Barry quickly does the math in his head and realizes that the turtle has absorbed enough energy he can stop the progression of time in Central City. Barry 
                    runs away and realizes that if he conducts enough kinetic energy, he would be able to break through the wall of turtles' powers. The problem however is that he's never ran that fast and He thinks it could kill him.<br><br> Barry decides to do it anyways and as he runs, and he conducts so much energy his body starts glowing. He hears a voice saying not to worry and to connect to the speed force 
                    as he breaks through the wall, he emerges with his suit now with gold boots a lightning symbol and wings on his ears.(<a href="Suit.html" id="movlink">see suit</a>) The turtle attacks Barry but Barry is so fast turtle attacks don't even phase 
                    him. He captures the turtle and sends him to prison.
                    <br>
                    <br> He goes back to a shocked Iris and tells her not to tell anyone about it. Iris agrees and tells Barry he needs a cool name like Batman. Barry laughs and they kiss as Barry picks her up and they leave 
                    however, Iris isn't hurt as Barry has developed the ability to create an aura around him that protects him as he's running. 
                    <br>
                    <br>Wally and Barry are at the lab when Iris arrives and tells Barry about 
                    their date but Barry hears the police radio and tells Iris he’ll see her later. Iris smiles and Wally confused ask Iris what happened Iris says nothing let’s go get something to eat. Barry runs out 
                    of the building with his invention a ring where he houses his suit, he puts his suit on and runs.
                    A newspapers first page flashes on the screen and the front page reads: Central City’s New Hero The Flash

                    In a credit scene, we hear a man (Billy Magnussen) say good now let’s try something new. He reveals his hand as a shock with red lightning cracks on his fingertips
