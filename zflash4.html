                    The Flash: Call of the Speed Force<br>
Wally’s head spins as he stumbles through the doorway, the mysterious voice leading him into a dazzling array of lights. Suddenly, a blinding flash of white light envelops him, and when it fades, he's standing in an unfamiliar place on Earth. The voice directs him to the Hall of Justice, and without hesitation, he rockets there using his super speed. Inside, his jaw drops as he spots another Flash entering the building.<br>
"Whoa, Barry! Wait up!" Wally calls out, sprinting after the Flash.<br>
He follows the mysterious Flash inside, who turns to face him with a grin. But something's off—this Flash looks different, with those eerie white eyes and a simpler, yet cool suit.<br>
The Flash: "Hey there, Wally, how's it hanging?"<br>
Wally: "Barry? What's going on? And what's up with the new look?"<br>
The Flash chuckles and shakes his head. “I’m not Barry, my man”.<br>
With a dramatic flourish, he takes off his mask and reveals his face as Wallace, but he insists Wally can just call him Wally. Confusion gnaws at Wally, and he demands an explanation. The Flash dives into the concept of the multiverse—parallel universes with infinite possibilities. As speedsters tied to the Speed Force, they can travel between these alternate worlds. Before Kid Flash can wrap his head around it, he interjects, saying this shouldn't even be possible without a Speed Force connection.<br>
The Flash isn't fazed, explaining that even without a direct link, the Speed Force must've brought Kid Flash here for a reason. And that reason, well, it's Kid Flash's job to figure it out. A crime alert interrupts their chat, and a siren blares in the hall. The Flash slips his mask back on, ready for action, and turns to Kid Flash with a grin.<br>
The Flash: “Hey, wanna help me out with this one? Could be a good way to figure thing’s out”<br>
Kid Flash nods, excitement and confusion mixing in his mind. Together, they sprint to the source of the crime—a convenience store where Captain Cold is wreaking havoc, hostages in tow.<br>
“Alright, Kid Flash, let’s do this” The Flash says, cracking his knuckles.<br>
Wally can't help but grin at being called as it reminds him of his Barry "Kid Flash." They execute a well-coordinated rescue, with The Flash distracting Captain Cold while Kid Flash manages to free most of the hostages without anyone noticing. But Captain Cold spots Kid Flash, and suddenly, icy blasts are flying everywhere. Kid Flash bolts, leaving one hapless hostage behind.<br>
The Flash tries to reason with Captain Cold, appealing to the better side he believes Cold has deep down.<br>
“Come on Snart, you’re not a total bad guy, you can stop this.” The Flash urges.<br>
Captain Cold ignores him, launching a barrage of icy attacks that catch The Flash off guard. Ice blasts smack him down, leaving him sprawled on the floor. But Kid Flash isn't one to back down. He steps up, trying to reason with Captain Cold in his own way. Kid Flash:” Snart! That’s your name right? I have a friend with a similar name. Snart I need you to do me a favor. Think about someone you love. They wouldn’t like this, come on you know they wouldn’t like this”. Kid Flash's warm smile could probably melt ice itself.<br>
“Listen, Snart, you’ve got good in you. Whether you like it or not, you’re not all bad.” Kid Flash says earnestly.<br>
Something clicks within Captain Cold, and he hesitates. He can't bring himself to shoot the hostage. His facade cracks, and he looks at Kid Flash with a mix of anger and defeat. The police rush in, taking Captain Cold into custody. The Flash comes to, clearly impressed by what he missed, and praises Kid Flash's approach.<br>
"That was textbook perfect, Kid Flash. You're shaping up to be everything a Flash should be," The Flash says with a proud grin.<br>
The mysterious voice echoes again, prompting The Flash to suggest they follow it. Kid Flash nods, and they head to another door, stepping through into a new environment. Determined, Kid Flash decides to find something familiar. He ends up at S.T.A.R Labs, where a criminal is trying to escape. Without hesitation, Kid Flash confronts him, sparking a fierce battle.<br>
This criminal isn't your average crook, though—he morphs into a toxic gas. Kid Flash realizes this won't be a walk in the park. In a quick-witted move, he uses his speed to create a whirlwind, trapping the criminal in a makeshift prison. With the bad guy in tow, Kid Flash delivers him to the police and heads back to S.T.A.R Labs.<br>
Just as he catches his breath, another speedster appears. Kid Flash's eyes widen, and he can't help but blurt out, "Wally?"<br>
The speedster grins, shaking his head. "Nah, not Wally. I'm The Flash."<br>
Kid Flash takes a closer look, the pieces falling into place. The suit, the demeanor—it's unmistakable. He chuckles, realizing who's under the mask.<br>
The Flash removes his own mask, revealing himself as Barry (Grant Gustin). "Hey, I know you. Seen what you've been up to. Impressive stuff."<br>
Kid Flash's head spins with questions, and he can't hold back. "Barry, what's with all this jumping around different Earths?"<br>
Barry laughs, leaning against a wall. "You, my friend, are getting a crash course in being a speedster. Seeing the world through the eyes of different Flashes, understanding what it really means to be a hero."<br>
Kid Flash's confusion isn't quelled, and he's itching for answers. Barry, however, assures him that time will bring clarity. But before they can delve deeper, reality shudders, cracking like a mirror. Barry vanishes, leaving Kid Flash on his own. A screech pierces the air, and the Speed Force engulfs Kid Flash, hurtling him into a surreal realm.<br>
In the midst of the chaos, a menacing figure clad in black emerges—the same black speedster who's been haunting Kid Flash. Fear grips Kid Flash as he tries to outrun his pursuer, but the black speedster is relentless. A fight ensues, but Kid Flash's efforts prove futile. Eventually, the black speedster banishes Kid Flash to a shadowy abyss.<br>
Lost and uncertain, Kid Flash realizes he's here to learn. Amid the darkness, a spark of light beckons. With a flash of inspiration, Kid Flash concocts a risky plan. He uses his speed to mimic a heart attack, luring the black speedster into the void. Seizing the opportunity, Kid Flash escapes. He awakens from his ordeal, triumphant over his shadowy adversary.<br>
The voice calls to him again, leading him through another door. This time, he's back on his own Earth, but the confusion remains. Undeterred, he sets off to find his Barry at the police station where he works. Along the way, he realizes he can't interact with anyone, his frustration mounting. Arriving at the station, Kid Flash resorts to knocking things over to get Barry's attention. A well-timed lightning strike later, Barry's down, unconscious. Kid Flash realizes he's back in time, witnessing the moment Barry gains his powers.<br>
As anxiety bubbles within him, Kid Flash heads to his own home, only to find it's not the place he knows. The black speedster reappears, but this time, Kid Flash is ready. He confronts his nemesis head-on, his determination fueling his fight. And then, something incredible happens. His veins pulse with the raw power of the Speed Force, surging through him like electricity. His attacks hit harder, and his speed is off the charts.<br>
With newfound strength, Kid Flash races toward the Speed Force itself, crashing into its currents. He's on a mission—to uncover the secrets of his journey, to find his place. And there, within the ethereal expanse of the Speed Force, answers beckon. A voice booms, proclaiming his destiny.<br>
Voice: "Wallace West, chosen you are. Avatar of the Speed Force, your mantle assumed. The universe's motion courses through your essence. Immeasurable speed and power bestowed. You are The Flash, the embodiment of heroism."<br>
Lightning courses through Kid Flash, and with newfound purpose, he surges from the Speed Force, a beacon of power and resolve. Back in the midst of a climactic battle in Flashpoint, Barry stands at the brink of defeat, defying Reverse Flash's ruthless assault. Amid their struggle, a burst of yellow lightning interrupts the fray. Barry witnesses Wally's emergence, a symbol of hope in the darkest of moments.<br>
Wally stands transformed, clad in the iconic red of The Flash, his aura crackling with the energy of the Speed Force. A narrative twists, and Wally's presence signals a turning tide—an embodiment of destiny, of heroism, and of the legacy that binds speedsters together.<br>
Reverse Flash is relentless, pursuing the flash with a fervor that mirrors his own speed. The clash between hero and villain ignites, a tempest of motion and velocity that shapes their intertwined fates. The Flash and the reverse flash fight in an epic battle. Wally being faster then thawne outruns him being the fastest man alive. His sheer power alone proves him to be more powerful then even barry. The Flash removes the speed force power from the reverse flash. Taunting him as he overpowers the reverse flash. Amidst this flurry of speed, Barry glimpses a vision of Aquaman taking captain atom, a scheme that could harness Captain Atom's power for cataclysmic devastation. The realization strikes Barry like lightning, urging him to action.<br>
The narrative unfolds as Barry heals himself and seeks out Batman's counsel. Suddenly Wonder Woman appears impaling Batman with her sword. Batman falls, wounded, and Barry holds the dying Thomas Wayne, providing a poignant connection before the end. In the midst of this heartache, Wally stands beside Barry, an unwavering pillar of support. The Batman dies as Barry and wally realize that they could make the world never have existed.<br>
Barry and wally arrive at the allen house. Barry enters and sees Nora cooking. Nora looks at her son and realizes that the new superhero the flash is her son. She hugs him proud but barry cries. He explains to nora that she died and shes not supposed to be alive. Nora cries but she understands what has to happen. She tells her son that she is proud of him. The hug and nora kisses Barry on the forehead. Barry leaves and reunites with wally outside.<br>
Together, they race toward a portal, a path leading to the moment that ignited Barry's journey—a chance to save his mother. Through the portal's shimmering vortex, echoes of history and alternate worlds collide, a tapestry woven from the threads of the multiverse. Flashes from different dimensions assemble, a convergence of incarnations that amplifies the legacy they carry.<br>
Amid this cacophony of speedsters, Barry merges with his past self the one that was going to save his mother, an act that bends time itself. Emerging from the vortex, the two Flashes stand united, poised to mend the timeline they once disrupted. Barry races to wayne manor to make sure everything is ok. In the heart of the Batcave barry sees batman is back to being bruce. Relieved he gives Bruce the letter which Bruce reads and then hugs barry. <br>

2 days later Barry and Wally are seen on a street both now sharing the mantle of the flash.<br>
Their journey's end is marked by a final race, a tribute to their camaraderie and shared purpose. Barry and Wally decide to race. Barry however knows that Wally is faster. They race but the difference is noticed. Wally's lightning shines with a brilliant yellow hue, a manifestation of his unique link to the Speed Force. Barry's lightning, in contrast, radiates an orange-yellow brilliance, symbolizing his enduring connection to the speedster legacy.<br>
As the credits roll, a luminous figure stands amidst a graveyard, surrounded by a haunting blue aura. Determination fuels their actions, and they surge forward, their speed a testament to their connection with the Speed Force.<br>
In a post-credits scene, Barry and Wally find themselves in Barry's abode, their conversation interrupted by the resounding echo of the Speed Force. Portals emerge, revealing a young speedster wearing goggles, their presence a puzzle waiting to be solved. With the goggles removed, Barry's eyes meet the speedster's, and a startling revelation emerges this speedster is his grandson. Meanwhile the sound of the speed force is heard again as a portal opens, however its not seen who it is.<br>
