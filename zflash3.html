                    Barry is surprised to see his mother, Nora, alive. He asks her, "Mom, how... how are you here?" Nora laughs and says, "Barry, you are just like your father, may he rest in peace. Always forgetting everything. I’m off work today, I told you that." Barry is now shocked to hear of his father's passing and starts crying. Nora sees this and replies, "Oh Barry, what’s wrong?" Barry says, "Nothing, Mom, it’s fine. I’m so happy you’re here, but I need to find Iris." Nora, confused, says, "Barry, you haven’t talked to Iris in years." Barry is now extremely worried to hear this and panics. He runs out of the house, reaches in his pocket but is surprised when he has nothing in it but his phone. He tries to use his powers to run to his lab but realizes that he no longer has a connection to the speed-force.
                    <br>
                    Elsewhere, Wally runs around the city and keeps noticing that the city is a lot more run down and dirty than it was. Wally tries to find Barry and runs to his and Iris’s house but only finds Iris. Iris sees Wally and screams, throwing things at him. Wally tries to calm Iris down and takes off his mask. Iris sees Wally’s face and starts crying. Wally asks her what’s wrong and is shocked to hear he committed suicide in this world.
                    <br>
                    Barry, now at the lab, tries to look up where Wally lives after realizing that this is not his world. He finds Wally’s obituary and is surprised to see that Wally committed suicide. After realizing he needs help, he takes a cab that drops him off at Wayne Manor. Barry notices that the Manor is broken down and seems abandoned. He is relieved when he sees that the secret entrance to the Batcave still works. He walks down the stairs and notices that the Batcave is completely different and a lot more dirty with there even being blood on the floor. Batman appears behind Barry and knocks him out.
                    <br>
                    Coming to, Barry calls out to Batman saying, "Bruce, it's me, Barry, let me out." Secretly worried that this Batman is someone else, Batman takes him out of his cell and punches him. Barry is now a lot more worried and says, "Bruce, what is going on with you? You wouldn’t hurt a normal civilian." Barry looks around the Batcave and sees a plaque that reads: "In loving memory of Bruce Wayne." Realizing that this Batman isn’t Bruce Wayne and after noticing he got mad again for mentioning his name, Barry realizes that this Batman is instead Thomas Wayne. Batman says, "Say my son's name again and you won't have to worry about waking up in that cell."
                    <br>
                    Barry says, "Thomas, I know it's you. I also know your son. We’re friends in another universe, you could even say coworkers." Thomas takes off his mask revealing his face (Jason O’Mara). He decides to listen to what Barry has to say. To prove himself, Barry mentions the mask of Zorro and tells Thomas that he knows that Zorro is the inspiration behind the Batman.
                    <br>
                    Barry convinces Thomas to help him fix things. Barry decides to recreate the accident that gave him his powers so he hooks up a lightning rod to a chair he attaches to a pulley system that will splash the chemicals on his body to trigger a connection to the speed-force. Worried about the other thing he needs, a thunderstorm, he decides to watch the news to look for the forecast as his phone was dead. The forecast is suddenly interrupted by a news report that reveals Wonder Woman and Aquaman are at war. It is also revealed that Wonder Woman is planning on decimating Europe and rebuilding Themyscira on her new territory.
                    <br>
                    Barry, horrified hearing the death total of this war, asks Batman what is going on. Batman explains as we see the backstory of this war. Aquaman launches an assault on Themyscira and after a terrible war, Aquaman kills Wonder Woman’s mother, and in a rage, Wonder Woman kills Arthur’s daughter. Wonder Woman and her husband, a bitter Superman after the Joker’s had killed his family, decide to take over the world in hopes of gaining supplies and weapons. A horrible world war with heroes and villains alike is destroying the world in the process. The forecast plays and Barry sees that like fate, there was a thunderstorm that very day. Batman with his mask back on looks at Barry and says, "What did you expect, it’s Gotham."
                    <br>
                    Barry sits on the chair and makes Batman promise that if things go wrong, they would try again. The lightning hits the rod and the lightning passes through Barry as the chemicals splash on him. It goes wrong, however, as Barry bursts into flames. Batman puts out the flames as Wally arrives at the manor. Scared, he decides to help Batman.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Batman, thinking he’s an intruder, attacks him but Barry screams and tells him not to. Wally runs Barry into the cave where Thomas treats his wounds. Barry, however, refuses and tries to convince Thomas to retry the experiment reminding him of his promise. Thomas begrudgingly agrees, to which Wally tries to stop, worried for his best friend. He sees that Barry really needs it to happen and eventually agrees. This time, though, Wally using what he’s learned studying as an engineer realizes that what Barry needs to do is have the lightning hit him instead of the rod. Thomas says that would be next to impossible but somehow a yellow lightning bolt hits Barry as Wally quickly throws the chemicals that splash on him.
                    <br>
                    Barry regains the connection to the speed-force as his eyes glow. They take Barry inside. Batman asks Barry how he’s healing so fast and Barry explains his abilities. Wally reminds Barry he needs a suit, so Barry retrieves friction-proof technology and recreates his purely red suit. When tapping into the speed-force, the suit recreates the symbol, gold wings, gold lines, and gold boots. Batman is surprised to see this but hides it with a smirk. Barry realizes that they have no idea what to do next. Batman asks how they got to this universe. Wally and Barry look at each other and realize they also have no idea how. Barry theorizes it could’ve been someone else. He also realizes that the speed-force exists outside of time and space and that he could maybe use it to travel back to his world, however, he’s not fast enough yet as his speed-force connection is at a beginner level because he just received it.
                    <br>
                    Wally comes up with a plan. They’ll try to stop the war and in the meanwhile, Barry should be able to gain a better connection that would take him and Wally back to their world. Barry and Batman agree, however, Batman has one condition, that they deliver a letter to Bruce. Barry agrees and they ride on the Bat-jet which is just an old plane that Thomas owns. Barry tells Batman that Bruce’s technology is a lot more improved to which Batman says, "Of course, Bruce was always really smart, his IQ was extremely high." Barry laughs but all of a sudden there’s a noise on the top of the plane. Batman realizes what it is and stops the plane and lands it back on land.
                    <br>
                    When they get out of the plane, Batman calls to Cyborg who made the noise from earlier. Flash in his suit looks at Cyborg but sees that he looks a lot different. He’s horrified to see that he looks damaged. Cyborg tells Batman, "We need your help, this war is getting worse and we need you, you’re the best strategist around and you’ve always been someone people look up to. You could unite us, they can’t agree on anything." Batman says no and tries to leave but Wally says, "Come on, this is exactly what we want, we need to join them." Barry agrees and says, "He’s right Thomas, this war is gonna take forever to stop and I’m not leaving until it’s over." Batman reconsiders the offer and agrees but tells Cyborg that The Flash and Kid Flash are coming with. Barry laughs and Wally rolls his eyes. The Plane lands at an abandoned shed and Wally is disappointed that “the big lair” is just an abandoned shed. But Cyborg reveals it’s only the entrance to the sub-basement where there’s a massive facility that the rebellion operates out of.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The rebellion is revealed to consist of: Cyborg (Ser’Darius Blane), Captain Atom (Richard Flood), Citizen Cold (Aaron Paul), Lex Luthor, (Zachary Quinto) Harley Quinn (Kayley Cuoco), Deathstroke (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Red Arrow (Taron Egerton), Superboy (Joshua Orpin), Robotman (Brendan Fraser), and The Question (Jensen Ackles). Barry and Wally greet the members of the team but Batman ignores them and heads into the conference room. Barry and Wally follow but Cyborg tries to stop them. Batman tells Cyborg to let them in and tells him they’re as equal as he is. Cyborg lets them pass and Captain Atom follows. Cyborg, Captain Atom, Batman, The Flash, and Kid Flash go into the conference room and lock the door. Cyborg says, "Okay, so the most important thing, we need to get Superman out of there. He’s the goal, he’s absorbed way too much energy from the sun after all the Joker’s killed his son. He’s immune to kryptonite but we have a plan." Batman interrupts and says, "If you have a plan why am I here? You don’t need me if you have a strategy." Captain Atom replies, "Well, we don’t have a plan, just an idea: We boom tube Superman to the nearest red sun. It should weaken him just enough so we could defeat him when he returns."
                    <br>
                    The Flash asks, "Wait how are you gonna do that? I know him, he is way too strong to be able to push him into the boom tube." Batman says, "I have a plan but it can only be us 5." The Group arrives in Europe and come across both sides of the war battling. Kid Flash watches in horror as Wonder Woman and Aquaman kill civilians and tries to come between them but Wonder Woman attacks him causing him to run away. The Group fights both Wonder Woman and Aquaman trying to stop the conflict. After a while, in battle, Wally steals the lasso of truth and asks Wonder Woman where Superman is, to which Wonder Woman smiles.
                    <br>
                    Superman crashes down and proceeds to chase after Wally and grabs him. The Flash sees this and tries to get Superman to grab him instead. Superman lets Kid Flash go and chases after The Flash. In a chase around the world, The Flash and Superman battle but Superman is too strong for The Flash and The Flash is too fast for Superman. They end up back in Europe after fighting for hours. Meanwhile, Kid Flash is helping civilians evacuate when Aquaman takes notice of him. Aquaman tries to grab Kid Flash but Kid Flash keeps running away. Thinking Kid Flash is a coward, he decides to let him go but Kid Flash arrives and keeps running back and forth hitting Aquaman. Eventually, however, Aquaman stops Kid Flash and grabs him just when Captain Atom shows up and punches Aquaman. Superman and The Flash arrive but The Flash disappears. All of a sudden, The Flash brings Cyborg at super speed and Cyborg opens a boom tube. Captain Atom punches Superman through the portal and Superman is weakened by the red sun that drains 87% of his power. He flies back to earth hitting The Flash and Flash falls into a puddle. The Flash looks at the puddle and notices a reflection of a man wearing a Flash suit but it’s yellow instead. He looks up and sees The Reverse Flash (Billy Magnussen) for the very first time.
                    <br>
                    Barry is confused and asks him who he is. The Reverse Flash creepily laughs and says, "Oh come on Barry, you know who I am, it’s me. I’m him. I’m the red lightning." Barry realizing who he’s talking to says, "You’re him. YOU’RE THE ONE WHO KILLED MY MOTHER." He runs to attack The Reverse Flash but fails as he uses his super speed to get out of the way. Barry keeps trying but he’s never able to catch up to him. The Reverse Flash takes off his mask and says, "Allow me to introduce myself. I am Eobard Thawne." Barry interrupts and says, "Thawne like Malcolm?" Thawne replies, "Yes, yes like him but he’s of no importance. I’m the important one here. I am THE villain! I killed your mother but you made my life a living hell." Barry says, "How did I make your life hell if I don’t even know you?"
                    <br>
                    Superman attacks Aquaman and hits him with his heat vision. But being weak, he depletes his reserve of energy and passes out. Aquaman goes to kill Superman but Captain Atom intervenes. They fight as Kid Flash and Batman come up with a way to defeat Wonder Woman. However, they see Barry and Thawne talking so they instead worry about Barry. Thawne says, "It doesn’t matter the only thing that matters is that you were my idol in the 27th century but then you went and stole what was rightfully mine. So I decided to take everything from you. I tried to kill you and I even succeeded once but I was fading out of existence so I time traveled and undid it. If I couldn’t kill you then instead I was going to ruin your life. I killed your mother."
                    <br>
                    Barry says, "Wait, time travel, how did you do that... wait it was you, wasn’t it? You’re the one who did all this, you traveled back in time and messed things up?!!" Thawne replies with a smirk, "Actually Barry, I didn’t even do a thing. Not a single thing. You really don’t remember? It was you. You did all this Barry and you know how." Barry realizes to himself that the night Malcolm killed Darryl he ran and he traveled back in time to save his mom from dying. Barry, horrified says, "No, how did I. I can’t. I would’ve remembered. How did... No, no, no... I did all this. All this destruction is my fault. That one act must have rippled out creating distortions everywhere."
                    <br>
                    Thawne laughs and says, "Oh but don’t worry, it’s all gonna end. See, because of this you created a paradox in which I was never born. But because I was able to follow you here, I exist, which means I exist out of the timeline. So now, I can kill you." He puts on his mask, runs to Barry, breaks his leg and holds him up in mid air. Wally gets really worried for Barry. He screams and runs at Barry with super speed but all of a sudden a bolt of lightning hits Wally causing him to disappear. Thawne laughs as a hurt Barry falls on the ground with Thawne ready to kill him.<br><br><br>Wally emerges in an unknown place where all he sees is infinite duplicates of himself, as if in a hall of mirrors. After a while, he realizes that some of the duplicates are different and he is confused. A loud voice echoes saying, "Come hero. Come here. Run."
