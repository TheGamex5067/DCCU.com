                   <p class="Movies"> The Flash rushes to a mall where he finds masked criminals attacking innocent civilians. The criminals notice him and move to attack, but Flash swiftly incapacitates most of them. He spots Wally (Kj Apa) in the mall and is worried but plays it off. Just then, one of the criminals presses a button on his hand. The Flash grabs him and demands to know what it is. The criminal confesses that he set off a bomb, set to detonate in 10 seconds. The Flash evacuates everyone from the mall, leaving Wally for last, as Wally was helping with the evacuation. With only 2 seconds left on the timer, The Flash grabs Wally and speeds away just as the bombs explode. The explosion destroys the exit, so The Flash finds an alternate route, which takes longer.<br>

                    Wally feels disoriented at first but soon starts perceiving things in slow motion. The Flash exits the mall and sets Wally down. He spots the criminal who set off the bomb attempting to escape. The Flash freezes time and pursues him. To Wally's surprise, he finds he can still move. He approaches Flash and witnesses the battle between Flash and the criminal, who inexplicably possesses super speed too. The criminal lands a blow on Flash and escapes. The Flash removes his mask, thinking he's invisible. Shocked, Wally discovers that Barry (Lucas Till) is The Flash.
                    
                    Barry, back at his lab, changes into his civilian clothes when Wally enters. Wally tells Barry he needs to talk. Worried, Barry asks what’s wrong, and Wally says: "I know you’re The Flash." Barry, taken aback, tries to deny it, but Wally insists: "Barry, I saw you take off your mask. I know you’re The Flash." Barry decides to come clean and admits: "Ok Wally, I’m sor-" Wally interrupts and says: "Dude, no hard feelings. I understand why you didn’t tell me. You just wanted me to be safe." Barry says: "Ok, thanks man. But seriously, how did you see me? I was running at super speed." Wally replies: "I genuinely do not know how. But, well, look."<br>
                    
                    Wally extends his hand, which vibrates at super speed. Barry, astonished, says: "Yes, another speedster!! Wait, but how are you connected to the speed force?" Wally asks: "What?" Barry responds: "I’ll explain later. Do you mind if I draw some blood? I have a friend who can analyze it, and then we can go for a test run." Wally agrees, and they go far away to a flat terrain where no one can see them. Barry instructs Wally to run as fast as he can. Wally complies, and Barry realizes that he doesn't generate electricity, indicating no connection to the speed force.<br>
                    
                    Wally returns and asks when he can start being a superhero. Barry, hesitant, says: "What, no Wally, you can’t. You’re not fast enough, and you’re just a kid." Wally argues: "We only have a five-year age difference. What’s the big deal?!" Barry insists: "Just forget it. The answer is no." Disappointed, Wally leaves.<br>
                    
                    Later, Barry analyzes Wally’s DNA and a sudden burst of air scatters all of Barry’s papers. One paper remains on the desk, revealing Wally’s abnormal DNA result. Barry calls Wally to the lab for further questions. Wally, still annoyed, complies. Barry asks: "When did you first feel different?" Wally recalls: "Well, when the mall was exploding, and you were carrying me."<br>
                    
                    After conducting research, Barry finds news articles about people who have gained abilities after going through a crisis. The common factor is an abnormal gene. Barry dubs it the "mutant gene," but Wally suggests a different name. They settle on "the abnormal gene." Wally continues to push Barry for permission to be a superhero, but Barry remains firm in his refusal. Wally leaves, frustrated.<br>
                    
                    Iris (Holland Roden) visits Barry at his lab, kisses him, and inquires if Wally is still upset. Barry confirms, saying he can't let Wally become a superhero. Iris counters: "But Barry, he’s not a kid. He can take care of himself. You know he’s always wanted to be something more." Barry explains his concerns, but Iris insists that Wally can handle it. She heads to work, leaving Barry behind.<br>
                    
                    Wally, meanwhile, tests his powers and saves a baby from wandering into the street. Suddenly, the escaped criminal spots Wally and attacks, but Wally uses his speed to flee. He rushes to the lab and informs Barry. Barry dons his suit and rushes to confront the criminal. Wally follows, eager to help, but Flash insists: "NO, Wally, go!" Although visibly frustrated, Wally decides not to interfere, opting to watch from a distance.<br>
                    
                    The Flash and the criminal engage in a fierce battle. The criminal wields blue energy, striking Flash with powerful blows. Flash retaliates, but the criminal conjures a blue sword and thrusts it toward The Flash. He narrowly evades and lands a punch before retreating, the earlier blow causing him considerable pain. Flash seizes Wally, and they sprint to Barry and Iris' house to regroup and argue.<br>
                    
                    Wally shouts: "If you would've let me help, we would’ve caught him!" Barry counters, explaining his reservations about Wally joining the fight. Their argument escalates, with Wally demanding an opportunity to prove himself. Barry stands his ground, emphasizing the dangers involved. Eventually, Wally storms off.<br>
                    
                    In his apartment, Wally resolves that if he's going to intervene, he'll need a suit. Remembering Barry mentioned having extra tech, he helps himself and crafts a suit featuring a vivid red design with a white lightning emblem. He embarks on a crusade, thwarting crimes and saving lives.<br>
                    
                    Meanwhile, Barry investigates the escaped criminal, piecing together his identity as Malcolm Thawne through witness accounts and photos. He uncovers a series of articles detailing the Thawne family's history of criminal activities, all involving a distinctive blue flame. Barry delves into Malcolm’s background, discovering his address. He surveils the location, waiting for Malcolm to leave so he can apprehend him.<br>
                    
                    When Malcolm finally steps outside, Barry makes his move, but Malcolm vanishes, reappearing behind Barry to land a punch. Flash exclaims: "I don’t understand. You have all this power, but you only target me. What gives?" Malcolm cryptically responds: "Well, Barry, not all of us are as good as you, now are we?" Surprised, Barry questions how Malcolm knows his name. Malcolm smirks: "I know a lot more than you think. I know your parents’ names, Nora and Henry. I know that you were struck by lightning and woke up only days later. I know you were born on March 14, 1989. The same as me."<br>
                    
                    Barry, incredulous, asks for an explanation. Malcolm reveals a shocking revelation: "Well, Barry, my 'Mom' Charlene went into labor the same day as Nora. But when the doctor was placing the baby in its bed, he accidentally killed it. He decided to cover it up by taking the Allen’s baby and giving it to the Thawne’s. Turns out the Allen’s had twins, so he stole one and gave it to the Thawne Family. That baby was me." Barry vehemently denies Malcolm's claims, insisting that his parents told him his twin was stillborn. Malcolm counters that the doctor fabricated a death certificate, and that he is Barry's brother. Overwhelmed, Barry is lifted into the air and pinned by Malcolm, who declares: "You got the life that I was supposed to have. Now, no one gets it."<br>
                    
                    As Malcolm prepares to strike Barry with his blue energy sword, Wally intervenes, landing a powerful blow on Malcolm before whisking Barry away. Barry, battered from the battle, inquires why Wally was there. Wally explains that he had researched Barry's likely move and knew he would be at the house. By helping, Wally hoped to prove he could be a hero. Barry smiles and, after a few hours of healing, he acknowledges: "If you’re going to do this, you have to listen to what I say." Wally asks for a superhero name, prompting Barry to suggest "Kid Flash." Wally scoffs at the name and insists on something else. Barry teases, "Oh, I’ve actually thought about this. KID FLASH!" Wally responds with disdain, declaring it's a terrible name. Barry chuckles, and Wally inquires about their next move regarding Malcolm. Barry decides they should hold off, reasoning that Malcolm is fixated on him, not anyone else.<br>
                    
                    Weeks pass, and Flash introduces Kid Flash as his sidekick to the public. The media embraces the name, and Kid Flash quickly becomes recognized as Flash's new partner. Meanwhile, Malcolm targets retired police captain Darryl Frye (Aaron Eckhart), kidnapping him. Barry, upon learning this, begins the search for Malcolm. Wally suggests Malcolm needs a striking villain name, akin to "Captain Cold." Barry acknowledges Wally's point and they settle on "Cobalt Blue." Determined, they use the Justice League’s satellite to locate energy anomalies. They pinpoint Cobalt Blue in a park, holding Darryl.<br>
                    
                    The Flash and Kid Flash arrive at the park. Kid Flash sprints forward to engage Cobalt, but Cobalt seizes him. As Barry moves to attack, Cobalt flings Wally aside and then grabs Barry by the neck, taunting: "You see, Barry, I’m going to make you just like me. Our mom was murdered, but I was tormented every day of my life. So instead, I’m going to take one of yours." He seizes Darryl and impales him with his sword. Barry, overcome with fury, launches a relentless assault, but to no avail. He decides to employ the same technique he used when he first became the Flash, channeling energy into a single punch. He races miles away, generating tremendous kinetic energy. Cobalt Blue, assuming Flash has given up, moves to kill Kid Flash. However, Flash hurtles forward, channeling an immense punch that strikes Cobalt Blue. The gem on Cobalt's chest shatters, depriving him of his powers. Barry relentlessly attacks him until Wally intervenes, urging Barry not to kill him. Barry subdues Cobalt, leaving him unconscious on the ground.<br>
                    
                    Barry, badly injured from the encounter, rushes to Darryl, who is mortally wounded. Darryl rasps: "Barry, I know you’re the Flash. I’ve always known. But promise me, no matter what, be careful kid." Darryl breathes his last in Barry’s arms. Barry screams and weeps, while Wally, in shock, witnesses the tragedy. Suddenly, Barry begins to crackle with electricity. Wally watches in astonishment as Barry accelerates faster than he ever has before. Wally gives chase, but he can't match Barry's speed. In an instant, both Barry and Wally vanish. Barry awakens in his childhood home, thoroughly bewildered. He descends the stairs and finds his mom (Sarah Drew) alive and well.<br>

                    In a post-credit scene, Wally emerges from a portal, wandering through an unfamiliar environment. He stumbles upon a newspaper and scans the headline. He drops it, then runs off. We draw nearer to the newspaper, which boldly declares: "World Faces Armageddon."
