                    <p class="Movies">Darkness creeps into the night as the bat signal becomes visible. Commissioner James Gordon mentions that the bat signal isn’t to call Batman, but to let the people know that he’s coming. Fear is a powerful tool, one that Batman knows all too well. A master at it, the Dark Knight is feared by all.

                        Bruce Wayne, billionaire, walks into Wayne Enterprises. People are shocked, even though this is a regular occurrence. Bruce enters a board meeting where he serves as the head of the board and majority shareholder, owning 80% of the company. However, he leaves all decisions to the other members as running Wayne Enterprises isn’t a priority to him; he just wants to ensure his family’s legacy is safe. During the meeting, board member Lucius Fox, who usually acts as Bruce’s proxy, mentions that Wayne Enterprises is doing better than it has in years, with profits up 40%. A bored Bruce Wayne decides to leave as he sees the meeting is in good hands. Before he does so, Roman Sionis, another wealthy and famous man, walks into the board meeting. Bruce decides to stay out of curiosity. Roman tells the board that he’s looking to buy shares of Wayne Enterprises. When asked why, he says it wouldn’t matter to them as he’s looking to pay a significant amount. Bruce does not like the idea, and after speaking to most of the board members, he manages to get them to agree with him. An annoyed Roman leaves the building.

                        Bruce arrives at Wayne Manor. The moment the door closes, and the public can no longer see him, his demeanor changes. Suddenly, this seemingly joyous and fun-loving man adopts a serious, stern look on his face. With a not angry, yet not exactly joyous expression, he calls to Alfred to prepare some food and take it into the cave.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Five hours pass, and we cut to two criminals mugging a lady in a dark alley. Suddenly, they hear a dark, echoing voice calling out, saying, "Leave the girl alone." The criminals suddenly feel a shock and fear like never before. They look up and see a shadowy creature with pure white eyes and sharp, pointy horns staring down at them. One of them yells, and the other tries to silence him. However, when he looks up again, he sees that the creature has disappeared. Suddenly, behind him stands the Batman, revealing himself.(see <a href="suit.html">suit</a>) The muggers try to attack, but land no blows. With a single attack, Batman incapacitates them and ties them to a light pole. The lady tries to thank him by offering money from her purse, but when she looks up, Batman has disappeared.

                        At another crime scene in the city, Batman watches with captivated eyes as he sees a group of criminals with massive piles of money. The moment he sees this, he understands what’s going on. Inside the building, the lights go out. Suddenly, a dim light turns on, revealing Batman standing in the middle of the room. The light goes out as the mobsters shoot at Batman. When the light comes back on, Batman is gone. In an echoey voice, he says, "Tell the Black Mask it’s over." After a commotion for 20 seconds, the lights come back on, and Batman stands again in the middle of the room.

                        This time, the men lay unconscious except for one, whom Batman instructs to run back to the Black Mask and tell him that Batman lives.

                        The next morning, Bruce Wayne, still working as Batman in the cave, orders new technology supplied by Lucius Fox. Alfred tells Bruce that he needs to get back to being himself and not this persona he dresses up with. A tortured expression of seriousness is seen on Bruce as he mentions that he is being himself. We flashback to the night Bruce’s parents died. Hours after the incident, Bruce Wayne stops crying. Since that day, Alfred notices that he hasn’t been himself and he never really got back to how he was. It was as if he was a different person. We cut back to the present day as Bruce tells Alfred: "I am Batman, that’s who I really am. I dress up as Bruce Wayne, billionaire extraordinaire, but that’s not who I am. Mom and Dad weren’t the only Waynes that died on that night." Alfred looks concerned but also understanding. He says that he knows Bruce would never be the same, but he doesn’t want to see him get hurt. Bruce looks at him with a warm smile and says, "I know, Alfred."

                        Batman analyzes Wayne Enterprises' financials and discovers a trail of shell companies and offshore accounts linked to Roman Sionis. It appears that Black Mask will stop at nothing to take control of Wayne Enterprises, which would explain why he was at the board meeting. As Batman follows the digital trail, he finds evidence suggesting an executive within the company is acting as a mole, being manipulated by Black Mask. Batman navigates the digital terrain, tracing the transactions to Wayne Enterprise's internal network. The Black Mask's move involves exploiting a mole within the company, turning a high-ranking executive against Bruce Wayne. Because he can't track who the mole is, Batman is stuck at a dead end.

                        Batman investigates the weaponry used by the Black Mask in his heists, leading him to an underground arms dealer with connections to a shadowy organization. Batman's encounters with the criminal underbelly expose a broader conspiracy, hinting at a looming threat that extends beyond Sionis. The investigation reaches a critical point in a covert meeting where Sionis seeks support from influential shareholders. Batman, armed with knowledge of Sionis' financial maneuvers, confronts the Black Mask. After seeing Batman, the mole immediately shifts his emotions, alerting Batman. Batman uses a batarang to threaten Richard Earle, who was being paid off by Sionis for inside information. Earle tells him where the Black Mask is: the Gotham City foundry.

                        Batman stealthily approaches the decaying Gotham City Foundry. The creaking gates and the distant echoes of dripping water set the eerie stage for the confrontation with Black Mask. As Batman infiltrates the abandoned facility, he encounters dimly lit corridors and rusted machinery, creating an atmosphere of suspense. Inside the foundry's central chamber, the Black Mask oversees his operations, surrounded by his henchmen and stolen weapons. Batman, using the shadows to his advantage, systematically takes down the guards one by one, creating an air of tension that hangs in the stale, musty air. The distinct clinking of metal against metal intensifies the silence as Batman easily dismantles the defense.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Batman finally confronts the Black Mask, who, caught off guard, tries to engage in hand-to-hand combat. The sound of echoing footsteps and the occasional hits against the metal backdrop amplify the intensity of the fight. Batman manages to unmask the Black Mask both literally and figuratively, revealing Sionis beneath the mask. Surprised, Sionis thinks that Batman may have already known, but even if he didn't, it's doubtful Batman would have reacted.

                        After Roman Sionis is apprehended, an associate of his wreaks havoc on Gotham. But this one’s different from the Black Mask. His name is Bane, and he’s different, stronger. Batman delves into the digital realm with a multifaceted approach, skillfully hacking through encrypted channels and immersing himself in the online forums where the faint whispers of Venom transactions linger. Clad in cutting-edge gear and armed with an array of surveillance tools, the Dark Knight navigates the virtual underworld, meticulously mapping out the intricate web of clandestine dealings. Nocturnal stakeouts become a regular routine as Batman strategically positions himself at recognized distribution hubs. From concealed vantage points, he silently observes the ebb and flow of Venom transactions, patiently awaiting the right moment to make a move. Thanks to the stealth and precision of his high-tech equipment, his presence goes undetected.

                        Covert raids unfold seamlessly as the Caped Crusader orchestrates disruptions at suspected production sites. Every move is carefully calculated, leaving behind no trace. Batman's mission has a dual purpose: to dismantle the cartel's operations and, equally important, to sow chaos within their ranks, diverting attention from his relentless pursuit. In a calculated move to indirectly thwart the cartel, Batman discreetly tips off law enforcement agencies about Venom distribution points, leveraging his intimate knowledge of the criminal underworld. Simultaneously, he navigates the intricate networks of Gotham's criminal hierarchy, attending clandestine meetings shrouded in secrecy, yet always staying concealed within the shadows.

                        The Dark Knight occasionally steps into the forefront, directly confronting mid-level operatives or those privy to Bane's closely guarded secrets. Employing a mix of physical prowess and an aura of intimidation, Batman extracts information without revealing his true identity. His encounters leave behind a lingering sense of fear and uncertainty among the criminal underbelly of Gotham. As the puzzle pieces fall into place, Batman begins to unravel the true orchestrator behind the Venom transactions. Through relentless pursuit, he discovers that Bane, the cunning mastermind, is leading him into a carefully orchestrated confrontation.

                        <br><br>
                        
                        In the dimly lit warehouse, Bane's imposing figure emerges from the shadows as Batman steps forward, his gaze locked onto the menacing silhouette. Batman, maintaining a stoic tone, remarks, "Bane, the puppet master behind the Venom transactions. You've led me on quite the dance." Bane, smirking confidently, responds in a fluid manner, "Ah, the Bat. Always one step behind, yet ever so persistent. But persistence won't save you tonight." Remaining calm, Batman questions, "You're using Venom to destabilize Gotham. What's your endgame?" Bane, with a subtle nod to his Mexican roots, speaks assuredly, "The city will crumble, and from its ashes, a new order will rise. One where chaos is the ruling force." With a serious demeanor, Batman asserts, "You won't succeed. I won't let you destroy Gotham." Bane, his tone filled with mock amusement, laughs, "Your city is already on the brink, Batman. You can't stop what's inevitable." Stepping forward, Batman confronts Bane, "I've dismantled your operations, exposed your network. This ends now, Bane." Bane, with a sinister smile, retorts, "You think you've won? You've merely played into my hands. The real game begins." Without warning, Bane charges at Batman.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        In the battle, Batman is overall better at combat but cannot compete with Bane's size and strength. In a moment, Bane grabs Bruce and yells out, "Down goes the bat." He knees Batman in the back, and Batman screams in extreme pain. Bane laughs and leaves. Bruce activates a beacon, and Alfred arrives moments later and sees a destroyed Batman. At the cave, Alfred uses Bruce’s technology and learns that Bruce’s back is broken and it will take months to heal. Alfred induces a medical coma for Bruce, not only to heal but because he worries Bruce will get himself killed.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        In the coma, we flashback. Ten years after the Wayne’s death, Bruce decides to go find who this new person is. He travels the world, visiting many places with many cultures. Ultimately, he realizes that crime exists everywhere but it’s managed. However, in Gotham, it isn’t. It’s as if Gotham was the darkest place in the world. The lives of the parents he loved so much were taken away in Gotham. Bruce does not want that to happen to someone else. He wants to end crime. He wants to start with Gotham and then he’ll do the world too. He trains under many masters of martial arts. He eventually finds a personal combat style for him, a combination of the skills and combat styles he’s learned. He eventually learns more secret forms of martial arts never heard before but especially excels at ninjutsu. He tempers his body through the fire of his training and the force of his will. Training under Chen Zheng (Daniel Dae Kim) led by the secret master Ra’s Al Ghul, Bruce Wayne became extremely powerful. Eventually returning to Gotham, he returns to the alley. Suddenly, a bat flies by. Bruce is startled and recalls his childhood fear of bats. This sparks inspiration. Fear, it can be harnessed, utilized, if he adopts the symbol of the bat he can bring an extra level of protection to the city. People would think 20 times before committing a crime out of fear that he will be there. He perches on a building watching the city in his newly constructed suit, a force of fear, strength, and will. Bruce Wayne died in that alley. But on that day, the Batman was born.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Bruce awakens from the coma. He screams in pain, and Alfred quickly gives him pain medication. Hours pass, and Bruce tries to get up, but Alfred stops him. Bruce argues with Alfred, and Alfred yells at Bruce: "I’m not gonna let them kill you too!" Bruce is confused and says, "Them? You too?" Alfred looks worried and pale. He closes his eyes in a moment of shame. Bruce looks at him confused and says, "It’s about my parents, isn’t it? It’s what happened to them." Alfred nods, and Bruce closes his eyes and breathes hard. Alfred explains: Thomas Wayne was a very famous and wealthy man. There was a secret organization that manipulated him, but Thomas found out about it. He refused to be manipulated after finding out that this organization was comprised of the rich people in Gotham who were members of a sort of court that was said to be based on the myth of the Court of Owls. Thomas learned the truth that the Court of Owls wasn’t based on a myth; the myth was based on the Court of Owls. They have existed as long as the story. Thomas worked really hard to put an end to them, but the court did not take it lightly. They needed to eliminate Thomas without it being tracked back to them. Alfred learned of this because Thomas confided in him; he made Alfred promise not to tell Bruce as this was Thomas's burden and not Bruce’s. Alfred reluctantly agreed. On that day, the Waynes died after watching a movie. Alfred later learned that the killer, Joe Chill, disappeared. He investigated and found him on the streets. He talked with him, and Joe Chill explained: "I was paid over 700,000 to kill the Wayne family by a mysterious guy. I took the money and was gonna do it. I tried to hide it as a mugging, but I couldn’t bring myself to pull the trigger. But he fought back so I tensed up, and the gun went off. The lady was screaming really loud, and I didn’t know what to do. I told her to shut up, but she wouldn’t listen so in an act of desperation I shot her too. But the kid, the lonely crying kid, I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t bring myself to kill him, so I just ran away. The guy who paid me the money put the fear of god in me, so I kept my mouth shut." Alfred tears up and tells Chill to turn himself in, and out of guilt, he does. Bruce cries after hearing all this but forgives Alfred as he understands why he did it. After this, he realizes that the Court of Owls influenced the Black Mask and Bane. He asks Alfred for his phone, and Bruce calls Lucius. Lucius arrives and tells Bruce that he has an experimental suit that would allow him to fight without the use of his back or legs. Then they can work on surgery to help Bruce’s back. Bruce wears the armor and goes to fight Bane.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        As Bruce lies in the hospital bed, his mind races with thoughts of Gotham's peril. Alfred, sensing Bruce's restlessness, retrieves a newspaper left on the bedside table. The headlines scream of chaos: "Bane's Reign of Terror Threatens Gotham's Heart."
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Bruce's jaw clenches as he reads through the article, detailing Bane's motivations and the devastation his actions could have wrought upon Wayne Tower and the city at large. Bane's vendetta against the Wayne legacy burns bright, fueled by a desire to break not just Batman but the spirit of Gotham itself.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        With grim determination, Bruce knows he cannot allow Bane's plans to come to fruition. Despite his physical limitations, he resolves to confront Bane head-on, knowing that Gotham's future hangs in the balance. Summoning Lucius once more, he insists on donning the experimental suit, determined to stand against the tide of darkness threatening to engulf his city.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        As the night falls, Gotham's skyline becomes a battleground. Amidst the shattered remnants of Wayne Tower, Batman and Bane clash in a showdown of titanic proportions. The streets below tremble with the force of their conflict as they trade bone-crushing blows and lightning-fast strikes.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Bane's forces, armed to the teeth and bolstered by his venom-enhanced strength, press their assault on Wayne Tower with relentless ferocity. Explosions rock the building as Batman fights his way through hordes of mercenaries, each step bringing him closer to his nemesis.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        In the heart of the chaos, Batman confronts Bane atop the tower's pinnacle, the city sprawling beneath them like a battlefield. Bane's eyes gleam with malice as he towers over Batman, his towering form a testament to his formidable strength.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        "It ends here, Bane," Batman growls, his voice a low rumble beneath the roar of the wind.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Bane sneers, his lips curling into a cruel grin. "You cannot stop what I have set in motion, Batman. Gotham will fall, and you will be powerless to prevent it." With a primal roar, the two adversaries clash once more, the sound of their battle echoing across the city skyline. Each blow exchanged reverberates through the night air, a testament to the stakes of their conflict.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        In the end, it is not just strength or technology that secures Batman's victory but his indomitable will and unwavering dedication to protecting the city he loves. With a final, decisive strike, Bane is subdued, his reign of terror brought to an end. As dawn breaks over Gotham once more, Bruce Wayne emerges from the shadows, battered but unbowed. The city may never know the true extent of the sacrifices made to keep it safe, but for now, the Dark Knight's watchful gaze offers a glimmer of hope in the darkness.

                        After the fight, Bruce awakens from surgery on his back, and Bruce is given two months to recover. Alfred says, "Sir, how are you feeling?" A drowsy Bruce replies, "I’m fine, Alfred, but I need to heal fast." Alfred knows he can’t convince Bruce of giving up the Batman, but he is curious as to why he needs to recover so fast. Bruce replies, "Because, if I’m going to finish what my father started, then I need to get working as soon as possible." Alfred looks confused and asks what is it that his father started. Bruce replies, "I’m going after the Court."

                        In the post-credit scene, Ra’s Al Ghul says to Chen Zheng, "Your former student has risen in Gotham, what are you to do, sir?" Suddenly, a lower ninja of the League of Shadows calls for Ra’s Al Ghul. The one who answers, however, is Chen Zheng, revealing himself to be the true Ra’s Al Ghul. The ninja tells him, "Sir, you’re losing allies. Roman Sionis has been apprehended."
