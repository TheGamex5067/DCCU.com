                    <p class="Movies">Darkness creeps into the night as the bat signal becomes visible. Commissioner James Gordon mentions that the bat signal isn’t to call Batman, but to let the people know that he’s coming. Fear is a powerful tool, one that Batman knows all too well. A master at it, the Dark Knight is feared by all.<br><br>
Bruce Wayne, billionaire, walks into Wayne Enterprises. People are shocked, even though this is a regular occurrence. Bruce enters a board meeting where he serves as the head of the board and majority shareholder, owning 80% of the company. However, he leaves all decisions to the other members as running Wayne Enterprises isn’t a priority to him; he just wants to ensure his family’s legacy is safe. During the meeting, board member Lucius Fox, who usually acts as Bruce’s proxy, mentions that Wayne Enterprises is doing better than it has in years, with profits up 40%. A bored Bruce Wayne decides to leave as he sees the meeting is in good hands. Before he does so, Roman Sionis, another wealthy and famous man, walks into the board meeting. Bruce decides to stay out of curiosity. Roman tells the board that he’s looking to buy shares of Wayne Enterprises. When asked why, he says it wouldn’t matter to them as he’s looking to pay a significant amount. Bruce does not like the idea, and after speaking to most of the board members, he manages to get them to agree with him. An annoyed Roman leaves the building.<br><br>

Bruce arrives at Wayne Manor. The moment the door closes, and the public can no longer see him, his demeanor changes. Suddenly, this seemingly joyous and fun-loving man adopts a serious, stern look on his face. With a not angry, yet not exactly joyous expression, he calls to Alfred to prepare some food and take it into the cave.<br><br>

Five hours pass, and we cut to two criminals mugging a lady in a dark alley. Suddenly, they hear a dark, echoing voice calling out, saying, "Leave the girl alone." The criminals suddenly feel a shock and fear like never before. They look up and see a shadowy creature with pure white eyes and sharp, pointy horns staring down at them. One of them yells, and the other tries to silence him. However, when he looks up again, he sees that the creature has disappeared. Suddenly, behind him stands the Batman, revealing himself(see <a href="Suit.html"> suit </a>).The muggers try to attack, but land no blows. With a single attack, Batman incapacitates them and ties them to a light pole. The lady tries to thank him by offering money from her purse, but when she looks up, Batman has disappeared.<br><br>

At another crime scene in the city, Batman watches with captivated eyes as he sees a group of criminals with massive piles of money. The moment he sees this, he understands what’s going on. Inside the building, the lights go out. Suddenly, a dim light turns on, revealing Batman standing in the middle of the room. The light goes out as the mobsters shoot at Batman. When the light comes back on, Batman is gone. In an echoey voice, he says, "Tell the Black Mask it’s over." After a commotion for 20 seconds, the lights come back on, and Batman stands again in the middle of the room. This time, the men lay unconscious except for one, whom Batman instructs to run back to the Black Mask and tell him that Batman lives.<br><br>

The next morning, Bruce Wayne, still working as Batman in the cave, orders new technology supplied by Lucius Fox. Alfred tells Bruce that he needs to get back to being himself and not this persona he dresses up with. A tortured expression of seriousness is seen on Bruce as he mentions that he is being himself. We flashback to the night Bruce’s parents died. Hours after the incident, Bruce Wayne stops crying. Since that day, Alfred notices that he hasn’t been himself and he never really got back to how he was. It was as if he was a different person. We cut back to the present day as Bruce tells Alfred: "I am Batman, that’s who I really am. I dress up as Bruce Wayne, billionaire extraordinaire, but that’s not who I am. Mom and Dad weren’t the only Waynes that died on that night." Alfred looks concerned but also understanding. He says that he knows Bruce would never be the same, but he doesn’t want to see him get hurt. Bruce looks at him with a warm smile and says, "I know, Alfred." Batman analyzes Wayne Enterprises' financials and discovers a trail of shell companies and offshore accounts linked to Roman Sionis. It appears that Black Mask will stop at nothing to take control of Wayne Enterprises, which would explain why he was at the board meeting. As Batman follows the digital trail, he finds evidence suggesting an executive within the company is acting as a mole, being manipulated by Black Mask.<br><br>

Batman navigates the digital terrain, tracing the transactions to Wayne Enterprise's internal network. The Black Mask's move involves exploiting a mole within the company, turning a high-ranking executive against Bruce Wayne. Because he can't track who the mole is, Batman is stuck at a dead end.<br><br>

Batman investigates the weaponry used by the Black Mask in his heists, leading him to an underground arms dealer with connections to a shadowy organization. Batman's encounters with the criminal underbelly expose a broader conspiracy, hinting at a looming threat that extends beyond Sionis. The investigation reaches a critical point in a covert meeting where Sionis seeks support from influential shareholders. Batman, armed with knowledge of Sionis' financial maneuvers, confronts the Black Mask. After seeing Batman, the mole immediately shifts his emotions, alerting Batman. Batman uses a batarang to threaten Richard Earle, who was being paid off by Sionis for inside information. Earle tells him where the Black Mask is: the Gotham City foundry.<br><br>

Batman stealthily approaches the decaying Gotham City Foundry. The creaking gates and the distant echoes of dripping water set the eerie stage for the confrontation with Black Mask. As Batman infiltrates the abandoned facility, he encounters dimly lit corridors and rusted machinery, creating an atmosphere of suspense. Inside the foundry's central chamber, the Black Mask oversees his operations, surrounded by his henchmen and stolen weapons. Batman, using the shadows to his advantage, systematically takes down the guards one by one, creating an air of tension that hangs in the stale, musty air. The distinct clinking of metal against metal intensifies the silence as Batman easily dismantles the defense.<br><br>

Batman finally confronts the Black Mask, who, caught off guard, tries to engage in hand-to-hand combat. The sound of echoing footsteps and the occasional hits against the metal backdrop amplify the intensity of the fight. Batman manages to unmask the Black Mask both literally and figuratively, revealing Sionis beneath the mask. Surprised, Sionis thinks that Batman may have already known, but even if he didn't, it's doubtful Batman would have reacted.<br><br>

After Roman Sionis is apprehended, an associate of his wreaks havoc on Gotham. But this one’s different from the Black Mask. His name is Bane, and he’s different, stronger. Batman investigates.<br><br>

Batman enters the digital world with a smart approach, skillfully navigating encrypted channels and immersing himself in online forums where whispers of Venom deals circulate. Equipped with advanced gear and surveillance tools, he explores the virtual underworld, carefully mapping out its hidden transactions. Nightly stakeouts become routine as he positions himself at key distribution centers, silently observing Venom exchanges from hidden spots, patiently waiting for the right moment to act, all while remaining undetected thanks to his high-tech equipment.<br><br>

Covert operations play out smoothly as Batman disrupts suspected production sites with precision, leaving no trace behind. His mission serves a dual purpose: dismantling the cartel's operations and sowing chaos within its ranks to divert attention from his pursuit. Through discreetly tipping off law enforcement about Venom distribution points and leveraging his knowledge of the criminal underworld, he indirectly thwarts the cartel's activities. Meanwhile, he maneuvers through Gotham's criminal hierarchy, attending secretive meetings while staying concealed in the shadows.<br><br>

Occasionally, the Dark Knight confronts mid-level operatives or those knowledgeable about Bane's secrets, using a mix of skill and intimidation to extract information without revealing his identity, leaving behind a sense of fear among Gotham's criminal element. As he pieces together the puzzle, Batman uncovers Bane as the true orchestrator behind the Venom transactions, leading him into a carefully planned confrontation.<br><br>

In the dimly lit warehouse, Bane's imposing figure emerges from the shadows as Batman steps forward, his gaze locked onto the menacing silhouette. Batman, maintaining a serious tone, remarks, "Bane, the mastermind behind the Venom transactions. You've led me on quite the chase." Bane, smirking confidently, responds smoothly, "Ah, the Bat. Always trailing behind, yet persistent. But your persistence won't save you tonight." Remaining composed, Batman questions, "You're using Venom to destabilize Gotham. What's your plan?" Bane, with a subtle nod to his Mexican heritage, speaks confidently, "The city will fall, and from its ruins, a new order will emerge. One where chaos reigns supreme." With determination, Batman asserts, "You won't succeed. I won't allow you to destroy Gotham." Bane, his tone tinged with amusement, chuckles, "Your city teeters on the edge, Batman. You can't prevent what's coming." Stepping closer, Batman confronts Bane, "I've disrupted your operations, exposed your network. This ends now, Bane." Bane, with a wicked grin, counters, "You believe you've triumphed? You've only played into my hands. The true game begins." Without hesitation, Bane charges towards Batman.<br><br>

During the battle, Batman's combat skills surpass Bane's, but he struggles against Bane's greater size and strength. Bane quickly grabs Bruce, dealing a devastating blow to his back, causing him to cry out in pain. Laughing triumphantly, Bane exits the scene. Bruce activates a distress signal, leading Alfred to arrive and find Batman severely injured. Back at the Batcave, Alfred takes advantage of Bruce's technology and determines he has a broken back, requiring months of recovery.<br><br>

In the coma, we flashback. Ten years after the Wayne’s death, Bruce decides to go find who this new person is. He travels the world, visiting many places with many cultures. Ultimately, he realizes that crime exists everywhere but it’s managed. However, in Gotham, it isn’t. It’s as if Gotham was the darkest place in the world. The lives of the parents he loved so much were taken away in Gotham. Bruce does not want that to happen to someone else. He wants to end crime. He wants to start with Gotham and then he’ll do the world too. He trains under many masters of martial arts. He eventually finds a personal combat style for him, a combination of the skills and combat styles he’s learned. He eventually learns more secret forms of martial arts never heard before but especially excels at ninjutsu. He tempers his body through the fire of his training and the force of his will. Training under Chen Zheng (Daniel Dae Kim) led by the secret master Ra’s Al Ghul, Bruce Wayne became extremely powerful. Eventually returning to Gotham, he returns to the alley. Suddenly, a bat flies by. Bruce is startled and recalls his childhood fear of bats. This sparks inspiration. Fear, it can be harnessed, utilized, if he adopts the symbol of the bat he can bring an extra level of protection to the city. People would think 20 times before committing a crime out of fear that he will be there. He perches on a building watching the city in his newly constructed suit, a force of fear, strength, and will. Bruce Wayne died in that alley. But on that day, the Batman was born.<br><br>

Bruce wakes from the coma, screaming in pain, and Alfred quickly gives him pain medication. As hours pass, Bruce tries to stand, but Alfred stops him. An argument breaks out between them, reaching its peak when Alfred bursts out, "I’m not gonna let them kill you too!" Confused, Bruce asks, "Them? You too?" Alfred, looking worried and pale, closes his eyes in shame. Bruce, puzzled, mentions his parents, which leads Alfred to nod gravely. Bruce closes his eyes, breathing heavily. Alfred proceeds to reveal the truth: Thomas Wayne, a prominent and wealthy figure, discovered a secret organization manipulating him. This group, known as the Court of Owls, included Gotham's elite, operating in secrecy. Thomas was determined to dismantle them, but they sought to eliminate him discreetly. Alfred, entrusted with this secret by Thomas, reluctantly agreed to keep it from Bruce. On the night of their deaths, Joe Chill, the killer, confessed to Alfred, revealing that he was paid to execute the Wayne family. Overwhelmed with guilt, Chill turns himself in. Bruce, tearful but understanding, forgives Alfred. Realizing the Court of Owls' influence on Black Mask and Bane, Bruce contacts Lucius for assistance. Lucius arrives with an experimental suit, allowing Bruce to fight despite his back injury. They plan for surgery to address Bruce's condition later. Donning the armor, Bruce prepares to confront Bane.<br><br>

Alfred, sensing Bruce's restlessness, retrieves a newspaper left on the bedside table. The headlines scream of chaos: "Bane's Reign of Terror Threatens Gotham's Heart."Bruce's jaw clenches as he reads through the article, detailing Bane's motivations and the devastation his actions could have wrought upon Wayne Tower and the city at large. Bane's vendetta against the Wayne legacy burns bright, fueled by a desire to break not just Batman but the spirit of Gotham itself.<br><br>

As the night falls, Gotham's skyline becomes a battleground. Amidst the shattered remnants of Wayne Tower, Batman and Bane clash in a showdown of titanic proportions. The streets below tremble with the force of their conflict as they trade bone-crushing blows and lightning-fast strikes.<br><br>

Bane's forces, armed to the teeth and bolstered by his venom-enhanced strength, press their assault on Wayne Tower with relentless ferocity. Explosions rock the building as Batman fights his way through hordes of mercenaries, each step bringing him closer to his nemesis.<br><br>

In the heart of the chaos, Batman confronts Bane atop the tower's pinnacle, the city sprawling beneath them like a battlefield. Bane's eyes gleam with malice as he towers over Batman, his towering form a testament to his formidable strength.<br><br>

"It ends here, Bane," Batman growls, his voice a low rumble beneath the roar of the wind.<br><br>

Bane sneers, his lips curling into a cruel grin. "You cannot stop what I have set in motion, Batman. Gotham will fall, and you will be powerless to prevent it."With a primal roar, the two adversaries clash once more, the sound of their battle echoing across the city skyline. Each blow exchanged reverberates through the night air, a testament to the stakes of their conflict.<br><br>

In the end, it is not just strength or technology that secures Batman's victory but his indomitable will and unwavering dedication to protecting the city he loves. With a final, decisive strike, Bane is subdued, his reign of terror brought to an end. As dawn breaks over Gotham once more, Bruce Wayne emerges from the shadows, battered but unbowed. The city may never know the true extent of the sacrifices made to keep it safe, but for now, the Dark Knight's watchful gaze offers a glimmer of hope in the darkness.After the fight, Bruce awakens from surgery on his back, and Bruce is given two months to recover. Alfred says, "Sir, how are you feeling?" A drowsy Bruce replies, "I’m fine, Alfred, but I need to heal fast." Alfred knows he can’t convince Bruce of giving up the Batman, but he is curious as to why he needs to recover so fast. Bruce replies, "Because, if I’m going to finish what my father started, then I need to get working as soon as possible." Alfred looks confused and asks what is it that his father started. Bruce replies, "I’m going after the Court."<br><br>

Roll credits.<br><br>

In the post-credit scene, Ra’s Al Ghul says to Chen Zheng, "Your former student has risen in Gotham, what are you to do, sir?" Suddenly, a lower ninja of the League of Shadows calls for Ra’s Al Ghul. The one who answers, however, is Chen Zheng, revealing himself to be the true Ra’s Al Ghul. The ninja tells him, "Sir, you’re losing allies. Roman Sionis has been apprehended." Ra’s says, "No matter, we lost one but we gained something far more than an Ally." He looks at a screen to see a photo of the Batman.
